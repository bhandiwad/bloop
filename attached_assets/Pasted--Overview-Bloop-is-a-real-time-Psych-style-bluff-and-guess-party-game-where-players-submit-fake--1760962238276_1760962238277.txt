🎮 Overview

Bloop is a real-time, Psych-style bluff-and-guess party game where players submit fake answers, try to fool others, and guess the truth.
It supports:
	•	Classic decks (Word Up, Movie Bluff, True Lies, etc.)
	•	Country decks (India, US, UK, Japan, Brazil …)
	•	Game decks (Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, Minecraft …)
	•	AI-generated fakes and a Family-Safe toggle

🧱 Core Requirements
	•	Frontend:
	•	React + Vite (responsive PWA).
	•	TailwindCSS + Framer Motion for clean, fast UI.
	•	Socket.io client for real-time updates.
	•	Installable PWA manifest + service worker (Workbox).
	•	Pages: Home, Create/Join Room, Lobby, Collect (answers), Vote, Reveal, Leaderboard, Settings.
	•	Accessibility: font-scale, reduce-motion, high-contrast mode.
	•	Backend:
	•	Node.js + TypeScript (Fastify or Express).
	•	Socket.io for real-time rooms.
	•	PostgreSQL for persistent data.
	•	Redis for ephemeral state (timers, rooms).
	•	REST + WebSocket APIs: create/join room, start round, submit answer, vote, reveal, scoring.
	•	JWT Auth (Firebase Auth / guest mode).
	•	Modular services: Game Engine, Deck Service, Scoring Engine, Moderation Service, AI Service.
	•	AI Integration:
	•	If < N players, call LLM (OpenAI or local) to generate believable fake answers.
	•	Rate-limit and moderate outputs before broadcast.
	•	Optional: weekly auto-deck generation (“Auto-Bloop”).
	•	Gameplay Logic:
	•	Collect phase 25 s (12 s Rapid Fire), Vote 20 s, Reveal 6 s.
	•	Scoring: Correct +2, Your Fake Chosen +1, Fool-All +2, Local Flair +1, Timeout –1.
	•	Leaderboard after each round.
	•	Family-Safe mode filters decks and answers.
	•	Moderation & Safety:
	•	Regex + locale blocklists + AI check.
	•	Report flow for answers/players.
	•	No public rooms by default.
	•	Optional “Simple Mode” (hides chat/GIFs).
	•	Content System:
	•	Deck → Category → Prompt tables with i18n keys.
	•	Seed ~300 prompts (120 Classic, 120 Country IN/US, 60 Brawl Stars).
	•	JSON import format for future decks.
	•	Translation table for multi-language support.
	•	Deployment:
	•	Dockerized services; PostgreSQL + Redis.
	•	Cloudflare R2/S3 for assets.
	•	CDN + HTTPS.
	•	Basic CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or Railway/Render deploy).
	•	Analytics (PostHog/Mixpanel).

📦 Deliverables
	•	Full monorepo structure (client + server).
	•	Database schema and migration SQL.
	•	REST and Socket.io handlers.
	•	Seed scripts for decks/prompts.
	•	Docker Compose for local run.
	•	Minimal UI kit + theme system.
	•	README with setup and dev scripts.

🎨 Stretch (if time permits)
	•	Offline support for rejoins.
	•	Simple AI deck builder (admin only).
	•	Shareable highlight screenshot after game.

Build in clear stages:
1️⃣ Design DB schema & socket protocol.
2️⃣ Implement backend services.
3️⃣ Scaffold React PWA with socket hooks.
4️⃣ Integrate decks + seed content.
5️⃣ Add AI fakes & moderation.
6️⃣ Polish UI + PWA manifest + analytics.
7️⃣ Package Docker Compose & deployment guide.

⚙️ Goal: Generate production-ready code and configs so I can docker compose up and play Bloop locally with friends on mobile browsers.
Provide source layout, commands, and sample .env values in output.
Keep the code clean, commented, and modular for later App Store porting.
